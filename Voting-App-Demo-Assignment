1. Commands that you used during the assignment.
--> kubectl create -f k8s-specifications/


2. snapshot of logs (wherever possible)
---> [root@ip-172-31-25-21 example-voting-app]# kubectl get pod
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-b54cd94f4-mp87x        1/1     Running   0          5d19h
redis-868d64d78-pmdp8     1/1     Running   0          5d19h

3. your comment on WHY result app STOPPED working after db pod stop
--> result app has opened static connection session with DB. Once DB pod stopped, result app is still using the old session which is no more valid
Hence result app will not receive any more data.

4. your answer to HOW YOU MADE THE RESULT POD work. 
--> Easy way - Restarted result pod again. When result pod comes up it will reinitate connection with db again and get the results

5. Some jargons (just names are enough- dont need sentences) that you learnt from the 40-hour Training session
--> Kubectl, kubelet, kube-proxy, controller, api-server, scheduler, pod, worker, master, ReplicaController, ReplicaSet, Job, CronJob, NodePort, service, Deployment, 
calico, hostnetowrk, proxy, envoy, pvc, pv, Stateful Set, daemon set, istdio, RBAC, secrets
