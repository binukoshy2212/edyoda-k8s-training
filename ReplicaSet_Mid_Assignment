1) What are the differences file-wise? --> Kind is different and in case of ReplicaSet, matchLabels is mandatory

2) Run the kubia-replicaset.yaml . --> Executed

3)Identify what commands can be run after "kubectl apply...." --> 
kubectl apply -f filename
kubectl apply -k directory
kubectl apply --prune
edit-last-applied
set-last-applied
view-last-applied


4)Make a service over these pods (kubia-replicaset) and see if the service picks up the web-service within the pod ("You have hit....." message) --> Done

5)Negative Testing : change the labels of the pod and see if the service is still applied on those pods --> Yes, since the Pods are started using ReplicaSet, k8s will 
new Pods having original label which will be used by the service
